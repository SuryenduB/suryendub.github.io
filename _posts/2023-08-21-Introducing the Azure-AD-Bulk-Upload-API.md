# Replacing MIM: Introducing the Azure AD Bulk Upload API, The Next Generation of Provisioning for Enterprise IAM

In a manner reminiscent of the content presented on this blog "MIM and Beyond," each successive release from Microsoft, n with the introduction of new Entra ID releases, demonstrates a gradual and purposeful shift towards more effectively replacing Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM).

Within enterprise environments, Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM) offers a distinctive capability by virtue of its comprehensive integration prowess. This is exemplified through the utilization of the [Extensible Connectivity 2.0 Management Agent Reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/forefront-2010/bb891983(v=vs.100) "ECMA"), the [Windows PowerShell Connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-identity-manager/reference/microsoft-identity-manager-2016-connector-powershell "Optional title"), and the [Grendfelt Powershell Management Agent](https://github.com/sorengranfeldt/psma "psma"). These mechanisms enable seamless connections with various systems encompassing the enterprise landscape.

Furthermore, the intrinsic capability to tailor data to align with the distinct requirements of enterprises is a key facet of MIM's value proposition. This customization is facilitated through tools such as [MIMWAL](https://microsoft.github.io/MIMWAL/) and the [Management Agent Rules Extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/forefront-2010/ms698793(v=vs.100)), enabling efficient data transformation processes.

In view of the aforementioned features and capabilities, Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM) emerges as a highly useful utility within the enterprise context.

However, Microsoft Entra ID has come up with capabilities for matching MIM Capabilities as follows.

## Introducing the Azure AD Bulk Upload API: The Future of Provisioning ðŸš€

The Azure AD provisioning service just got a major upgrade making us one step closer towards MIM Replacement and even Active Directory Replacement Now, it plays super well with all sorts of HR systems. ðŸŽ‰ Enterprise IAM Admins  can take their pick of automation tools ( [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/inbound-provisioning-api-powershell) or [Logic App](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/inbound-provisioning-api-logic-apps) ) to integrate employee data from their record systems and smoothly transfer it into Azure AD or On Premises AD.

 ðŸŒŸ Once your workforce data is in Azure AD, you can use Lifecycle Workflows to automate onboarding, offboarding, and other common identity lifecycle Joiner , Mover , Leaver tasks.  ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¼
