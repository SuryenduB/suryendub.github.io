# STAR Method of Narration

The STAR method is a structured approach for answering behavioral interview questions, particularly those that ask about past experiences. STAR stands for:
```diff
- S - Situation: Describe the context or background of the experience.
! T - Task: Explain what you were responsible for or what you had to achieve.
+ A - Action: Detail the specific actions you took to complete the task.
@@ R - Result: Outline the outcome of your actions, including any achievements or lessons learned. @@
```



## Example: Implementing Security Measures in an Azure Environment

### Situation: 
I was working as a cloud engineer for a company that was using Azure as its primary cloud platform. The company was concerned about the security of its sensitive data and wanted to implement stronger security measures to protect it. 

### Task: 
My task was to research and implement security measures that would enhance the security of the company's Azure environment and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of its sensitive data.

### Action: 
I performed a thorough security assessment of the company's Azure environment and identified potential security threats and vulnerabilities. I then implemented the following security measures to mitigate these risks: 
- Enforced multi-factor authentication for all users 
- Implemented Azure Active Directory for identity and access management 
- Configured Network Security Groups to restrict inbound and outbound traffic 
- Encrypted sensitive data stored in Azure Storage accounts 
- Regularly conducted security audits and implemented patches for any security vulnerabilities 

### Result: 
As a result of the security measures I implemented, the company's Azure environment became much more secure and the sensitive data was protected. The company received no security breaches or data loss incidents, and the overall security posture of the company was improved. This helped to instill confidence in the company's stakeholders and customers, and contributed to the company's success.
