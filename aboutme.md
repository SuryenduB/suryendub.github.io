I provide technical support and guidance for identity and access management (IAM) solutions, using Microsoft Identity Manager and Entra ID.  

Previously, I was a Cybersecurity Consultant at Microsoft, where I designed and implemented security solutions for various clients, using Azure, Terraform, and other tools. I obtained multiple Microsoft certifications in security, compliance, and identity domains, demonstrating my proficiency and expertise in these areas. I have a Bachelor in Technology in Computer Science And Engineering from the Government College Of Engineering and Textile Technology, Berhampore. I am passionate about learning new technologies and skills and staying updated with the latest trends and best practices in the cybersecurity field. I am also committed to delivering secure, efficient, and reliable solutions that meet the expectations and requirements of the customers and the organization.
